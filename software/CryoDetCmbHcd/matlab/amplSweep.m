function [resp, f] = amplSweep(band, freqs, Nread, dwell)
% Sweep frequency, plot amplitude and phase
% band selects one of 32 sub bands (only 0:7 presently allowed)
% freqs is a vector of frequencies in the range -19.2 (MHz) to + 19.2 (MHz)

% resp is complex response demodulated response
% Nread (optional) number of reads of response per frequency setting
% dwell (optional) dwell time between setting and read and between reads
% Example:
%   Response  = ampleSweep(7, (-9.6:.1:9.6)*1e6) sweeps from -9.6 MHz to
%   +9.6 MHz in steps of 100kHz
